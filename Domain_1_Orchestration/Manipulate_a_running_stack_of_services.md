# Manipulate a running stack of services

A running stack of services on Docker Swarm can be manipulated in different ways: `docker stack ls` shows an overview of all existing stacks. `docker stack ps STACK` lists all tasks in a stack, while `docker stack services STACK` gives an overview over the running services. `docker stack rm STACK` removes said stack.
