Minimum requirements
- 8GB of RAM for manager nodes or nodes running DTR
- 4GB of RAM for worker nodes
- 3GB of free disk space

Recommended production requirements
- 16GB of RAM for manager nodes or nodes running DTR
- 4 vCPUs for manager nodes or nodes running DTR
- 25-100GB of free disk space


### DTR

- RAM: Generally 4GB is considered sufficient for smaller production installations.
- DISK (DTR itself, not image storage): 20-30GB.
- DISK (image storage): â€‹ The requirements for the storage of Docker container images used in conjunction with DTR will scale linearly with the size and number of images, as well as how much I/O will be conducted.
- CPU: modern dual core processors are likely to be sufficient.
